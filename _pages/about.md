Hi! I am an Associate Research Scientist at Telef√≥nica Research, from 2022. Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Barcelona Neural Networking center (BNN-UPC), from 2020 to 2022. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC), in 2020, and a B.Sc and M.Sc. degrees in Telecommunication Engineering from the Universidad de Granada (UGR). Currently I work actively in several EU-funded and national projects.

In the past, I was co-Principal Investigator of the IGNNITION project (H2020 NGI POINTER), and main organizer of the Graph Neural Networking challenge, an international competition co-organized with the ITU (United Nations).

The following is a non-exhaustive list of my research interests:
- Machine Learning applied to communication networks
- Network Planning and Operations
- Network Digital Twins
- Traffic Monitoring and Analysis
- Graph-based Deep Learning / Geometric Deep Learning
- Deep Reinforcement Learning
